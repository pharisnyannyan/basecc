# TODO

- [ ] Define the parser AST model for declarations, statements, and expressions.
- [ ] Decide on child representation (`first_child`/`next` list vs. `children` array).
- [ ] Implement parsing for basic statements (`return`, compound blocks, if/while).
- [ ] Add error recovery strategy and diagnostics with source locations.
- [ ] Expand unit tests for valid/invalid programs and edge cases.
